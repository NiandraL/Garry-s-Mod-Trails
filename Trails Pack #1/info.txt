Here's a small custom trails pack I put together, while messing around on Photoshop. This is originally for Empyrean-Gaming.co.uk's WiP Minigames server and not everything has been included here. My graphic settings are on low and the script errors in the corner are from an unrelated menu I never finished. 

In this pack you'll find;

1. Paw Prints
2. Footprints
3. Girl Power
4. Handprints
5. Male Trail
6. Musical Notes
7. Red Arrow

These files are located inside [i]materials/trails[/i]. For example, [i]materials/trails/pawprints.vmt[/i] or [i]/trails/musicalnotes.vmt[/i]. All of the files are basically named the exact same as that list, except there's no spaces. If you need additional help setting this up for the pointshop, lemme know!

[b]Issues and things to note:[/b]

1. The previews in the Pointshop looked a little weird when I test them. I assume this is the .vtf being weird. If you have any ideas on how to change/fix this, do tell me.

2. If you have a suggestion for a trail, or want any of the colours changed, drop me a comment or friend request and I'll get right on it. 

3. I'm still working through testing these on Singleplayer and there's still a couple I haven't examined. 'cuz of this, there may be some issues and if there is, once again, tell me so I can get that shit sorted. 

4. I also do custom TTT icons. If you think you may be interested: I've done before: http://empyreangaming.co.uk/portfolio.html"
